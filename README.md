# Multi-Category Text Classification

This repository contains two PyTorch implementations for multi-category text classification on news articles (labels: business, tech, politics, sport, entertainment):

- **CNN + LSTM** (`CNN_LSTM.py`)
- **Transformer (no positional encoding)** (`train_transformer.py`)

Both models share the same data-loading pipeline and evaluation scripts.
