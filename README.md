# Multi-Category Text Classification

This repository contains two PyTorch implementations for multi-category text classification on news articles (labels: business, tech, politics, sport, entertainment):

- **CNN + LSTM** (`CNN_LSTM.py`)
- **Transformer (no positional encoding)** (`TRANSFORMER.py`)

Both models share the same data-loading pipeline and evaluation scripts.

TrainData.csv and TestLabels.csv should be in the same folder as CNN_LSTM.py and TRANSFORMER.py
